## Dependencies

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - A framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - A wrapper around InheritedWidget to manage state.
- [switcher_button](https://pub.dev/packages/switcher_button) - A customizable toggle switch button for Flutter, used for dark mode and light mode switching.

## How It Works

The app is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with a focus on usability. The home page displays a list of products, which users can browse and add to their cart. The cart page allows users to review their selections and remove items if needed. The app supports both dark mode and light mode, providing a comfortable user experience in any lighting condition. State management is handled using the `Provider` package, ensuring a smooth and responsive interface.
